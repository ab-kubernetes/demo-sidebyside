Download and install go
https://golang.org/dl/

go build gonow.go

then run the compiled executable
./gonow

curl localhost:8000/hello

ctrl-c

Note: go compiles to native and if you have been using a Mac/Windows
you likely need to recompile the binary, the dockerbuild.sh has the Linux build

./dockerbuild.sh
